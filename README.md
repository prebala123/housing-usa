# Summary
For this project I wanted to explore housing prices across the United States because I wanted to see what kind of housing people can buy and at what prices. I was interested in this project because I wanted to find housing for myself next year and I wanted to see if there were trends across the country that could help me find some ideas on what to look for. I got the data from a Kaggle dataset <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/usa-housing-listings?resource=download'> here</a>. In this project I used D3.js to visualize several different types of interactive plots including a scatterplot, barplot, and choropleth to analyze housing costs. I also made use of HTML/CSS and JavaScript for creating the page to display the graphs.
